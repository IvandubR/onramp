## onchainwizard thesis
1. Find projects that are different, and hard to replicate
2. That are backed by great teams and advisors
3. With a low starting market cap, with minimal CT shills
4. With good supply side token structures
5. With key upcoming catalysts / partnerships that you find in a project discord
6. Build your own conviction, donâ€™t outsource it from a CT shill
7. And potentially most importantly, bring down the number of projects you actually invest in. There are not that many innovative or special things being built, and you only have so much time + capital to put to work. If you pull the trigger on something, it needs to have the potential to open up a lot of TVL/usage or bring new users into the space.
